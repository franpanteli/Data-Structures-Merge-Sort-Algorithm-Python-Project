# Data-Structures-Merge-Sort-Algorithm-Python-Project
### About This Repository
I independently completed freeCodeCampâ€™s [Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) certification, to invest in my scientific computing skills with Python. This repository contains my independent problem-solving work, as part of the eighth project in this curriculum. I devised a script for this ([Merge-Sort-Algorithm.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Structures-Merge-Sort-Algorithm-Python-Project/blob/main/Merge-Sort-Algorithm.py)), which defined a function (`merge_sort(array)`) - to apply the merge sort algorithm to an array. This used a divide and conquer approach by recursively splitting its input array into two, until each element formed its own list. These lists were sorted and combined into a return array, or in the case that a single element was inputted into the function this was returned. A `__name__ == '__main__'` block was finally implemented, to test the function. The project .py file includes in-depth problem solving approaches used to write this program, and my [problem solving thought process notes](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Structures-Merge-Sort-Algorithm-Python-Project/blob/main/Merge%20Sort%20Algorithm%20Problem%20Solving%20Thought%20Process%20Notes.txt) contain further theory. This enabled me to invest in my sorting algorithm skills with Python and marked the successful completion of the eighth project in the certification.
